###Short Path All Wheel Drive

This HD family XY Gantry provides the opportunity to add two additional stepper motors to your printer.
We call this AWD version Shorth Path due to the diagonal arrangement of the motors. This reduces the belt distance between motor and print head.
The XYHD gantry are meant for very large printers or for the ones with very high performance in mind.

In this particular klipper configuration:
- A BTT SKR3EZ is used to drive the BTT5160T Plus.
- Multiple LED strips are controlled by Macros
- A power logic removes the 48VDC from stepper drivers when they are disabled

**IMPORTANT!** Always disable drivers before applying or removing MotorVoltage (24VDC or 48VDC).
