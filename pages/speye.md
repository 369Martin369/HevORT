# The SpEye Filament and Jam Detector
<right> <h1>The SpEye Filament and Jam Detector</h1> </right>

Not only this unit will pause your print when you are out of filament, but it will also do the same if you have a spool jam.  
Sensitivity can be adjusted to adapt to your setup.

I also use it as a pause button :)
