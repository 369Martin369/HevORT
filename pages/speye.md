# The SpEye Filament and Jam Detector

Not only this unit will pause your print when you are out of filament, but it will also do the same if you have a spool jam.  
Sensitivity can be adjusted to adapt to your setup.

I also use it as a pause button :)

Material|PLA, PETG, ABS
Support|NO, ensure your bridging settings are good.  You may need to file a bit the roof of the plunger section.
Layer Thickness|Try to keep it between 0.1mm and 0.2mm. Thicker layer will create friction on the filament when loding it to the SpEye
