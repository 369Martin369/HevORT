If you want to have your **mod** added to this site it needs to conform to some **rules**
that are supposed to keep **everything clean & organized**.

1. Every contribution is required to have an image clearly showing the mod.
  - Ideally this image should be saved inside the **/docs/assets/images/mods** folder
    in this repository to improve loading speed.
  - Externally hosted image is allowed but needs to stay available.
    A mod without an image will be **removed** until the image is restored.
  - If multiple images are required for your mod,
    these should the saved in a separate folder inside **/docs/assets/images/mods/[your mod folder]**.
  - When multiple images are used your mod should also be hosted on a separate page.
    Take the [SpEye](pages/mods/spy-eye.md) as an example
    The panel shown on this site should then redirect to that side. Example: [Other](#other) => SpEye.
2. Any mod or file made available/showcased
   in this repository/project can be modified or used by **anyone**!
3. If your mod is a mod of someone else work. A credit section has to be added!
  - If possible. The changes/contribution of credited users should be explained.
  - If you are the original creator of the mod, just your name is enough.
3. If more description is required to explain your mod than can comfortable fit into the description.
   The mod should be moved to a separate page
4. Mod files like stl, step or other files should be hosted externally
   to allow you to modify them without requiring the changes to be merged.
5. CAD files like **.step** are not a requirement but are desired.
  - If CAD files are provided they need to be in a general format like **.step**
  - Program specific cad files are not allowed. The files should be usable by anyone!
6. Hardware needed have to be in the description, this also includes any special software required.
7. If the mod requires specific configuration in the firmware. An example with explanations is desired.
