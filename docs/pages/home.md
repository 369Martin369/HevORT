## What is the HevORT?

In a nutshell, the HevORT is a DIY 3D printer that is meant to push the boundaries of FDM printing  
in terms of Speed,  
repeatability & 
maintainability.  


Quality will be the same as any well calibrated FDM only the HevORT prints to that quality level faster... much faster! :)
