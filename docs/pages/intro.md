# **INTRO**

## Why the HevORT?
I got into 3D printing by building a CoreXY [Hypercube Evolution 300X300X300 (HEVO)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254103).  
This was a very good learning experience for me as I learned how 3D printers work and how to actually 3D print.

After several months of printing and looking closely at the design from the HEVO, I came up with a few ideas on how to improve the design based on my needs and **my thirst for speed**.    
Well, first thing I knew, I was now on the path of designing my own 3D printer.  Pulling back my mechanical engineering course notes from long time ago I learned Fusion360...    
Those ideas lead me to design what is now known as the HevORT (Hypercube Evolution Olivier RT).

If ever you decide to build this machine, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

## The Design Philosophy
- Stepper Motors to be out of the heat chamber and at the back of the printer
- Maximized ratio between XY print area vs frame dimension
- Triple Z motor Self-Leveling *(True term would be Auto-leveling , but the common use for Auto-leveling designates software compensation based on topographic mapping of the bed)*
- Wide and Tall front printer opening without extrusion member in the line of sight to the print head.
- Rigid Gantry for achieving high acceleration and speed using a direct drive extruder
- No metal machining of parts (or limited as much as possible)
- Open Source data
