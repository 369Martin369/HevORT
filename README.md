# Welcome to the HevORT project!

### Why the HevORT?  
I got into 3D printing by building a Hypercube Evolution 300X300X300 (HEVO).  This was a very good learning experience for me.  After several months of printing and looking closely at the design from the HEVO i had some ideas for improving some areas based on my needs.

Well, first thing I know, I am now designing my own printer model using freshly acquired Fusion360 knowledge.  Pulling back my mecanical engineering course notes from way back then... I have designed what is now known as the HevORT (Hypercube Evolution Olivier RT).

### The initial design philosophy and requirements were:
- Stepper Motors to be out of the heat chamber and at back of printer
- Maximized ratio between XY print area vs frame dimension
- Triple Z motor Self-Leveling *(True term would be Auto-leveling , but the common use for Auto-leveling designates software compensation based on topographic mapping of the bed)*
- Wide and Tall from printer opnening without extrusion member in the line of sight to the print head.
- Rigid Gantry for achieving high acceleration and speed using direct drive extruder
- No metal machining of parts (or limited as much as possible)
- Open Source data

This page will hopefuly provide you with all of the information you need to build the HevORT you need.
