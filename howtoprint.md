# How to print the HevORT STLs?

## 1. Which material?
Pretty much any common 3D printing material can be used to print the HevORT parts.  
After trying a few materials over the years, here is how I would categorise them in a very non-scientific way:


_**Rigidity**: Force required to induce deflexion.  
**Crack Resistant**: Amount of deflexion before rupture. (Non-Brittleness)  
**Layer Adhesion**: Difference between forces required to break perpendicular to layers VS parralel to layers.  
**Heat Resistance**: Temperetaure value from which material looses its rigidity in Celcius degrees.  
**Easy to print**: Level of technical knowledge or special equipment required in order to achieve good prints._  


Material|Brand|Price|Rigidity|Crack Resistant|Layer Adhesion|Heat Resistance|Easy to Print|Special Print Condition|
--------|-----|-----|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------:  |-------------|-----------------------|
ASA|FormFutura ApolloX|$$$$|++++|+++|+++|98|++++|Enclosure|
ABS|Spool3D.ca|$$|++++|+++|++++|105|+++|Enclosure|
Nylon PA12|Filaments.ca|$$$|+++++|++++|+++++|110|+|SuperDry + Enclosure + Bed Adhesion compound
Nylon HDCF|Filaments.ca|$$$$$|++++|+++++|+++++|167|++|Dry + Enclosure + Bed Adhesion compound
Nylon Alloy910|Taulman3D|$$$$|++|+++++|+++++|82|++++|Dry|
PETG|Filaments.ca|$$$|+++|+++|++++|85|+++|Dry|
PETG CF|Filament.ca|$$$|++++|+++|+++|90|+++|Dry|
PLA|Filament.ca EcoTough|$$$|++++|+++|++++|65|+++++|NA|
PLA|Generic|$$|+++++|++|++++|65|+++++|NA|
_PC Polycarbonate_| _Never tried yet..._

I am currently running ABS on the big parts and HDCF Nylon for the more technical parts such as the Y and X carriages.

## 2. Placing your parts in the slicer.
All STL files are already properly oriented for optimal print results and optimal layer orientation.  

## 3. Slicer Settings
In this section I will assume that you have some experience with 3D printing and that your printer is calibrated.  If you are not too sure about what I mean by calibrated, have a look at [my personal recipee for printer calibration](/printercalibration.md){:target="_blank"}

The following printer settings are based on [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura){:target="_blank"} setting nomenclature which may vary if you are using a different slicer.
