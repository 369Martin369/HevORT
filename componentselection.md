# Which STLs do I need?

The HevORT project has been designed to be modular. This means you can select from multiple components configuration and assemble the one that will suit your needs.  

## 1. XY Gantry
You will find below the various configuration for XY Gantry.  Select one in function of your needs:

Configuration|Description|Image|ReleaseDate|Thingiverse
-------------|-----------|-----|-----------|-----------
Standard XY|This version is suited for the comonly available GT2 pulleys.  These pulleys available from china and other location are 9mm thick and have wider flanges(lips).|![alt text](/images/XYThumb.png)|April 2019|[HevORT XY](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4184477)
XY High Temp|The High Temp version of the XY gantry features 5mm bore pulleys.  These are slightly thicker (10mm) and have a narrower lips.  Note that due to expreme compactness of some components, transition bushings are necessary to fit the 5mm bore onto 3mm hardware.|![alt text](/images/XYHTThumb.png)|May 2020|[HevORT XYHT](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4402495)
Heavy Duty XY|Upcoming. Featuring: 9mm Belt, Center Pulley Bore Dowell Pins, MGN12H instead of MGN12C and more...|NA|*Sept 2020*||

## 2. Z Axis and Build Plate
Configuration|Description|Image|ReleaseDate|Thingiverse
-------------|-----------|-----|-----------|-----------
ZR|This initial version of the Self Leveling Z axis on MGN rails from the HevORT works just fine if you are using quality Ball screws with excellent frame alignment as well as perfect tolerances printed parts... Sounds impossible to get?  look at V2 below :)|![alt text](/images/ZRThumb.png)|Feb 2020|[ZR](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4184059)
ZR V2 (Wobble wings)|Some may say, get proper alignment, get quality parts, go back to lead screw... Well  The size of the bed on that printer makes it quite heavy.  Moving it down and up in a non planar printing mode will get standards lead screw to wear out pretty quick.  So for the ones of us who did not win the cheap ball screw lottery, this version of ZR system introduces Z wobble management using magnets and ball bearings.  Also a second thrust bearing was added to allow the use of a M10X1.00 nut to secure the ball screw better.||May 2020|[ZR V2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4387638)
HyperCube Evolution Z Adapters|Upcoming. This option will let you use standard [Hypercube Evolution from SCOTT_3D](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254103) Z installation to your HevORT printer.||_Aug 2020_
