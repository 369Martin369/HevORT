# Choosing Electronic Components

## 1. The Control Board
3D printer electronics have come a long way since the popular RAMP.  32 bit boards are now the standard and more stepper motor drivers are being added.
The additional stepper drivers can be mapped to serve different purpose; tool changer, multiple material extruder, etc...

The HevORT's basic requirements to use the ZR (self leveling) is that you have at least 6 intependent stepper motor drivers.
1. X axis
2. Y axis
3. Extruder
4. First Z motor
5. Second Z motor
6. Third Z motor

At this point as I only have experience with one specific control board, the documentation from this site will only cover that board. For now...

Considered by many as the Cadillac of control boards, this open source device has many advantages over the majority of current available boards.  A bit more expensive, but nobody ever regretted... At least that I know of...

What is the Duet?
